DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
A new bookstore is opened recently and it needs a web application to stay in touch with their clients and also advertise their business through it. To attract more customers, they think that an online presence would benefit a lot to them and increase the activity of their business. 
All we aim is to make the relationship of the bookstore and clients strong but also easy. The main purpose is to stay in touch with people all the time and show them all the potential of the bookstore online so it can be a time saving process for them so they don’t have to go directly to the bookstore if they are searching for a specific book. But also give the clients recommendations and suggestions that they might be interested to in purpose to influence them to buy and interact with the business.
DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION
The web application that we will develop will display all the books that the store offers, first the book cover than a brief information for every book. To give the users an easier and faster experience the application will give them the opportunity to search whatever book they want and if the book is available in the bookstore it will be shown to the clients. All the books will be divided in categories like action, romance, novel etc so it will be easier for the customers to find what they like. 
  This application will be able to let the admin update their online bookstore every time a new book will be added or deleted. Also, it will be able to give the customer opportunities to see the prices, suggestions, create a personal account where they can add their favourite books etc.
This web application will give the contact information of the bookstore the email address, social media accounts, the bookstore location.
* There will be updates so other features will be added until the end of this project.
