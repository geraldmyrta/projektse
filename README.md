DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
The project's primary goal is to  create an online library for an Albanian collage, that will shorten the time it takes for students to find and check out a specific book. No book searches will be available through the online library based on author, book title, release year, etc. The search's findings will be displayed in tabular format, together with general information on the requested book and suggestions for other books that might be borrowed in order to satisfy the request. To make searching easier, the books will be split into a number of categories.


DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION
The web application that we will develop will display all the books that the library offers, first the book cover than a brief information for every book. 
  This application will be able to let the admin update their online bookstore every time a new book will be added or deleted. 

* There will be updates so other features will be added until the end of this project.
